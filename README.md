## This Project Demonstrates advanced linux commands and how to use them.

### Basic File Permissions
Linux assigns permissions to three types of users:

* Owner (User) – The user who created the file.

* Group – Users who are part of a specific group.

* Others (World) – All other users on the system.

### Each file/directory has three types of permissions:

* Read (r) – Allows viewing file contents or listing directory contents.

* Write (w) – Allows modifying file contents or creating/deleting files in a directory.

* Execute (x) – Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory.
